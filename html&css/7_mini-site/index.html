		<h2>Intro</h2>

		<p>
		The giant panda, also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a bear native to south central China.
		<br>
		Is it not cute? :)
		</p>

		<h2>Where it lives</h2>
		<p>
			The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu. As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived, and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species.
