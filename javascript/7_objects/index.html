	// In JavaScript almost everything is an object.
	// Like an array, an object is a container for several values.
	// But with object, each value has got a dedicated key to access the value.

	// We create an object to store all infos for a ship
	let myShip = {}

	myShip.length = "23m"; //myShip["size"] = "23m" would be equal. But the dot notation is much more common
	myShip.price = "34000â‚¬";
	myShip.name = "Nautilus";
	myShip.cabins = 3;
	myShip.currentPosition = "Kotor";

	// Show the current position
	document.getElementById("position").innerHTML = "Currently my ship " + myShip.name + " is in: " + myShip.currentPosition;

	// We can also use objects in objects
	myShip.crew = { "captain": "Aurora", "sailor": "Drini" };
	// Print the captain
	console.log(myShip.crew.captain);
