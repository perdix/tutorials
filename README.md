# Tutorial Snippets

Code snippets and tutorials for various programming languages.
Ordered by difficulty, from super easy to use-case ready!

Serves as a reminder for myself, for students and to anyone who likes to use it.

Currently, you'll find snippets of:

- HTML&CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Svelte/Kit

If somethings is out of date, if you find any errors or if you want to add snippets, I am happy to accept any PRs. Just send me a message!
